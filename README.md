# many-pictures.github.io
A website that shows lots of pictures. Do you have a spare computer & monitor just sitting around? Why not spruce it up!

This site goes through pixabay and displays a scroll of all images by id, increasing in chronological order. Use the scroll wheel to change the speed. If you go as fast as possible, you might run go through all photos in 100 days! If you do, props to you! Clear your cookies & start over :)

## Setup
- go to https://pixabay.com/api/docs/
- create a free account & login
- Ctrl+F "Your API key:" & copy the key (highlighted in green)
- go to https://many-pictures.github.io/ and input your api key in the top input box
- press enter
- enjoy!

## features
